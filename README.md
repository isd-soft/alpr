### Intro
Number Plate Validator is an Internet based application , that aims to ease the process of validating the number plates of cars in different contexts of business, f.e track the cars that are entering or exiting a company's property. The main idea is that at the entrance a man will take photos with the phone of the plates entering a property and he will get a response if that car is  allowed to enter or not - taking into consideration a provided list with all the allowed cars to enter and their departments/branches etc. Also the system will have the ability to count the number of empty/full parking spots by increasing/decreasing the number of cars that entered/exited.
